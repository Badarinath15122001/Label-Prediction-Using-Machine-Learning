# Label-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
🚀 Stack Overflow Label Prediction Using ML – A machine learning model that predicts relevant tags for Stack Overflow questions using Logistic Regression with OneVsRest Classifier. It preprocesses text with NLTK, NumPy, Pandas, improving accuracy.
# 🚀 Label Prediction Using Machine Learning  

## 📌 Overview  
Stack Overflow is the largest online platform for developers to ask and answer coding-related questions. Manually tagging questions can be **time-consuming** and **prone to errors**.  

This project uses **Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to **automatically predict relevant tags** for Stack Overflow questions based on their **title and description**. The model is trained using **Logistic Regression with OneVsRest Classifier**, optimizing **accuracy and recall** for multi-label classification.

## 🎯 Features  
✅ Predicts relevant Stack Overflow tags based on the question.  
✅ Uses **Logistic Regression + OneVsRest Classifier**.  
✅ Includes **NLP preprocessing** (tokenization, stopwords removal).  
✅ Trained on **large Stack Overflow datasets**.  
✅ Implemented in **Jupyter Notebook**.
